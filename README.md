# ThirstV2

A 2D scroller game made for fun. You play as a cactus hunting for water to feed his family (or just because he is thirsty or something).

Limitations arose when developing this game in Python 3.9 (see, ThirstV1), and since I figured it was probably a good idea to get experience developing a larger project in C++ I switched to C++ and SDL2. There are some grander ideas I hope to implement in the future (algorithms for dynamic enemy types, procedural generation of textures and entity placement), but for right now I am setting up the basic mechanics and libraries I will use for the game.
